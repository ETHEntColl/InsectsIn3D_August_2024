<aside>
ðŸ“Œ Attention: Lifting the lid creates a vacuum (low pressure) in the box. Please lift the lid slowly so that the fragile specimens (especially wings) do not shake. The specimens are dried to be conserved for many years (ETHZ collection up to ~200 years). Unfortunately, the specimens get more brittle over time.
